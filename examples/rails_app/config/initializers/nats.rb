# Hint: don't do subscriptions in the initializer as they will be run in
# the app server master process which you probably don't want.
# Do them in a special dedicated processes, see bin/nats-listener script for an example.

# NATS client does request/response and subscription multiplexing from different callers,
# so connection pooling isn't necessary â€“ you can use a single instance for the whole app.
